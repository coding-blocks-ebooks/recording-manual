# 1. Recording Hardware

## 1.1 Camera

We prefer **NOT** to use inbuilt webcam of a laptop as the quality is subpar. Please use a professional webcam.

1. Logitech 920 or 930e Webcam

2. Microsoft Lifecam 1080p

It is also recommended to use a tripod with the camera.

## 1.2 Microphone

As with camera, the inbuilt microphone of a laptop is also **NOT RECOMMENDED**. We prefer to either use the audio of the webcam, or a dedicated USB microphone like _**Blue Snowball**_.

## 1.3 Graphics Tablet

When teaching, the ability to quickly draw something and show it is immensely powerful tool of expression. We highly recommend using a touchscreen-enabled laptop or an external graphics tablet to achieve this functionality. 

We can recommend the following options. 

### 1.3.1 Use a Surface Pro

Best support for screen annotation, scratchpad etc out of the box with the best stylus support.

### 1.3.2 Use a Wacom Tablet

We would recommend the **Wacom One** or the **Wacom Intuous Pro.**

### 1.3.2 Use iPad/iPad Pro with Apple Pencil

This option is specifically for Macbook users. You can get the _**iPad 2018**_ or the _**iPad Pro**_ which support Apple Pencil and connect it to your Macbook using [Astropad](https://astropad.com/) or [Duet Display](https://duetdisplay.com)
