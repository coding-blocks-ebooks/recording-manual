# 1. Recording Hardware

## 1.1 Camera

We prefer **NOT** to use inbuilt webcam of a laptop as the quality is subpar. Please use a professional webcam.

1. Logitech 920 or 930e Webcam

2. Microsoft Lifecam 1080p

It is also recommended to use a tripod with the camera. 



## 1.2 Microphone

As with camera, the inbuilt microphone of a laptop is also **NOT RECOMMENDED**. We prefer to either use the audio of the webcam, or a dedicated USB microphone like _**Blue Snowball**_.
